Project "Find the best place for our company"

The aim of this project is to find the best location for a company, around the world.

The repository contains the following files:

    - 'companies.json'
    - 'df_filtered.ipynb'
    - 'df_geoquery.ipynb'

Requeriments

    First of all, it's important to stay near to young companies (start ups). In this project, this is the most important requirement. My first decition was to select companies which were founded after 2013.

    I've used Google API to find close to the radius schools or kindergarten and Starbucks.

Result

After all the process, the best location to the company is Market Street (Manchester, United Kingdom). There are two companies with my requirements, but Gimigo (Seattle) has any nursery around.
